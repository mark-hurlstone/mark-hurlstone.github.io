My latest paper with Susie Wang, Zoe Leviston, Iain Walker, and Carmen Lawrence, "Construal Level Theory and Psychological Distancing: Implications for Grand Environmental Challenges" has just been accepted for publication in *One Earth*. The summary for the paper is below:

> Research in social and cognitive sciences has used the Construal Level Theory (CLT) of psychological distance as a framework for understanding environmental challenges such as climate change. This primer reflects on the how psychological distance and construal can help to understand environmental challenges, from the perceptions and social construction of environmental issues as distant and abstract, to implications for decision-making and action towards long-term targets. We also reflect on areas where the theory and concept are less useful, when assuming that psychological distance and construal level can be easily reduced or altered to promote lasting changes to environmental action.
