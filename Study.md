## Supervision opportunities
If you are interested in doing an honours project or PhD under my supervision—and your research interests align with my own—then please get in contact with me to discuss possible opportunities. I am always on the look out for conscientious and bright students with a keen interest in conducting psychological research.  In the first instance, please email me with an expression of interest outlining your research interests and the kind of project you would like to undertake.  

I am also sometimes able to offer laboratory placements to undergraduate students in my lab to provide some hands on experience of conducting psychological research. If you are interested in such opportunities then please get in touch with me.
