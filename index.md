## Biography      

<p> I completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at the University of Leicester before completing a Master's degree in Reading, Language, and Cognition followed by a PhD on short-term memory (supervisors: Graham Hitch and Alan Baddeley), both at the University of York. After a brief post-doctoral stint at Cardiff University working on auditory distraction (with Rob Hughes and Dylan Jones), I moved to the University of Western Australia, where I am currently an Assistant Professor.</p>

*Cognitive modelling:* computational and mathematical modelling of cognitive processes; model evaluation and selection issues; models of choice behaviour and response time.
