My latest paper with Li Qian Tay and colleagues, "Thinking clearly about misinformation", has just been accepted for publication in *Communications Psychology*. The abstract for the paper is below:

>  There is concern that many social problems in Western societies have been caused by misinformation. However, some researchers argue that misinformation is merely a symptom of such problems. We argue that (1) this is a false dichotomy, (2) misinformation has had clear impacts, and (3) researchers should consider the different dimensions of misinformation when making such evaluations.
