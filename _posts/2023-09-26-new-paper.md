My latest paper with Li Qian Tay and colleagues, "A focus shift in the evaluation of misinformation interventions", has just been accepted for publication in the *Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review*. The abstract for the paper is below:

>  The proliferation of misinformation has prompted significant research efforts, leading to the development of a wide range of interventions. There is, however, insufficient guidance on how to evaluate these interventions. Here, we argue that researchers should consider not just the interventionsâ€™ primary effectiveness but also ancillary outcomes and implementation challenges.
